### ⭐ By the end of the series, participants will be able to:

- Explain the **workflow** of supervised learning (data > model > evaluation).
- Implement and tune classification and regression models such as **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, **k-NN**, and **Random Forest**.
- Understand and apply **evaluation metrics** like RMSE, MAE, F1, and ROC to evaluate performance and interpret results.
- Build a **reproducible ML pipeline** on real data using **scikit-learn**.

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

### 🧑‍💻 Run in Google Colab

Open directly in Colab — no installation required:

- [Day 2 Notebook – Algorithms](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DalMLSociety/Supervised-Learning-Workshop/blob/main/notebooks/1_algorithms.ipynb)
- [Day 3 Notebook – Spotify Project](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DalMLSociety/Supervised-Learning-Workshop/blob/main/notebooks/2_spotify_project.ipynb)

**NOTE:** When running [Day 3 Notebook – Spotify Project](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DalMLSociety/Supervised-Learning-Workshop/blob/main/notebooks/2_spotify_project.ipynb) in Google Colab, you must upload the dataset (`./notebooks/data/spotify-dataset.csv`):

1. Download and save the `spotify-dataset.csv` locally.
2. When prompted in Colab during the setup, upload the CSV you saved.

## 📒 **Deliverable**

The deliverable includes completing **one of three** different machine learning problems:

1. `Customer Churn` – Predict which telecom customers will leave the service (**binary classification**)
2. `Credit Risk` – Predict likelihood a loan applicant will default (**binary classification**)
3. `Housing Prices` – Predict house sale price (**regression**)

Each dataset contains **real-world data challenges** (e.g., missing values, outliers, duplicates)
that make them ideal for practicing data cleaning, preprocessing, and model building.

### Instructions

1. Choose one of the notebooks and download its corresponding dataset from this repo.

   - All datasets are located in the `./deliverable/data/` directory.

2. Open the notebook in Google Colab:

   - 📘 [Deliverable 1 – Dataset 1 Notebook (Customer Churn)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DalMLSociety/Supervised-Learning-Workshop/blob/main/deliverable/01_dataset1.ipynb)
   - 📙 [Deliverable 2 – Dataset 2 Notebook (Credit Risk)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DalMLSociety/Supervised-Learning-Workshop/blob/main/deliverable/02_dataset2.ipynb)
   - 📗 [Deliverable 3 – Dataset 3 Notebook (Housing Prices)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DalMLSociety/Supervised-Learning-Workshop/blob/main/deliverable/03_dataset3.ipynb)

3. Follow the instructions in each notebook:

   - Load and explore the data
   - Handle missing values and outliers
   - Clean and preprocess features
   - Train machine learning models
   - Evaluate performance
   - Create visualizations
   - Briefly summarize your findings

The notebooks provide structure and guidance but leave the implementation up to you. \
This is intentional - you'll learn more by working through the problems yourself.

### 📤 Submission!

Once you have completed your notebook:

1. **Download your notebook and figures** from Google Colab

> ⚠️ Important: If your Colab session idles too long, it may restart. \
>  You will need to re-upload your dataset and re-run your notebook before saving figures.

- `File → Download → Download .ipynb`
- Download `figures_dataset#.zip` from the left side pane

2. **Upload your completed notebook here:**
